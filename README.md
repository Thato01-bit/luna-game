# Luna Game Frontend

The **Luna Game Frontend** is a user interface for the Luna Game application. It allows players and knocksmen to interact with the game, register accounts, log in, and perform game actions in a seamless and responsive environment. This frontend communicates with the **LunaGameBackend API** to manage users, roles, and game data.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Players and Knocksmen can sign up and log in.
- **Role-Based Views**: The UI adapts based on the user's role (player or knocksman).
- **Interactive Game Interface**: Visual components for playing the Luna Game.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices.
- **API Integration**: Connects to the backend API to fetch, update, and manage data.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts for invalid credentials or missing data.
